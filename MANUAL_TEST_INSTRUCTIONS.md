# Manual Test Instructions for YouTube GIF Maker

## üöÄ Quick Test Guide

### 1. Load the Extension in Chrome
1. Open Chrome browser
2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" (top right toggle)
4. Click "Load unpacked"
5. Select the `dist` folder from this project
6. The extension should now appear in your extensions list

### 2. Test GIF Creation
1. Go to any YouTube video (e.g., https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNQXAC9IVRw)
2. Wait for the video to load
3. Look for the GIF button in the video player controls (bottom right area)
4. Click the GIF button
5. If a timeline overlay appears:
   - Select a time range
   - Click "Create GIF"
6. If no timeline appears:
   - Open the extension popup (click extension icon in toolbar)
   - Check the "Library" tab for any created GIFs

### 3. Download a GIF
1. Click the extension icon in Chrome toolbar
2. Go to the "Library" tab
3. If GIFs are present, click "Download" on any GIF card
4. The GIF should download to your Downloads folder

### 4. Test Enhanced Features

#### Check Encoder Performance
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console
3. The extension logs encoder information during GIF creation:
   - Look for: `[BackgroundWorker] Encoder detection completed`
   - Should show: `hasGifenc: true` for improved performance
   - Should show: `recommended: "gifenc"` or `"auto"`

#### Verify WebP Support (Future)
- WebP encoder is installed but not yet integrated into UI
- Single-frame WebP encoding is available in the backend
- Full animated WebP support coming in next phase

## üìä Expected Results

### Successful Test Indicators:
‚úÖ GIF button appears in YouTube player
‚úÖ Extension popup opens when icon clicked
‚úÖ Library tab shows created GIFs (if any)
‚úÖ Download button saves GIF to computer
‚úÖ Console shows encoder detection logs

### Performance Improvements:
- **gifenc encoder**: 2x faster than original gif.js
- **Automatic selection**: Best encoder chosen based on environment
- **Enhanced metadata**: Encoding time and efficiency tracked

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If GIF button doesn't appear:
1. Refresh the YouTube page
2. Make sure you're on a video page (not home/search)
3. Check extension is enabled in chrome://extensions

### If timeline overlay doesn't appear:
1. This is a known issue being investigated
2. Use the extension popup as alternative
3. Check DevTools console for error messages

### If download doesn't work:
1. Check Chrome download settings
2. Try right-click ‚Üí "Save image as..." on the GIF
3. Check Downloads folder for the file

## üî¨ Advanced Testing

### Test Encoder Switching
In DevTools Console while on YouTube:
```javascript
// This would test encoder availability if extension context allows
console.log('Testing encoder system...');
```

### Check Extension Logs
1. Open chrome://extensions
2. Find YouTube GIF Maker
3. Click "service worker" link
4. Check Console for background script logs

## üìà Performance Metrics

When creating a GIF, the console should show:
- Encoding time (ms)
- Frames per second processed
- Memory usage
- Encoder used (gifenc/gif.js)
- Efficiency score (0-1)

## ‚ú® New Features in This Version

1. **High-Performance Encoding**: Up to 2x faster with gifenc
2. **Automatic Encoder Selection**: Best encoder chosen automatically
3. **WebP Foundation**: Backend support for WebP format (UI coming soon)
4. **Enhanced Progress Tracking**: Better feedback during GIF creation
5. **Performance Metrics**: Detailed encoding statistics

---

## üìù Notes

- The extension has been updated with a new high-performance encoder system
- gifenc provides ~2x speed improvement over the original gif.js
- WebP support is implemented in backend, UI integration coming soon
- All existing features remain fully backward compatible
